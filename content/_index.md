Hey! I'm a programmer with a background in pure mathematics, more specifically, Riemannian geometry and geometric partial differential equations. This is where I write about mathematics, programming, and things I find interesting. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/benjamin-kruger) or send me an [email](mailto:contact@benjamin-kruger.com).
